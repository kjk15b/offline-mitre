   "description": "[Masquerading (T1036)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/) is defined by ATT&CK as follows:\n\n\"Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate task or service names.\"\n\nMalware authors often use this technique to hide malicious executables behind legitimate Windows executable names (e.g. `lsass.exe`, `svchost.exe`, etc).\n\nThere are several sub-techniques, but this analytic focuses on [Match Legitimate Name or Location](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/) only.\n\n**Analytic Methodology**\n\nWith process monitoring, hunt for processes matching these criteria:\n\n* process name is `svchost.exe`, `smss.exe`, `wininit.exe`, `taskhost.exe`, etc.\n* process path is not `C:\\Windows\\System32\\` or `C:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\`\n\nExamples (true positive):\n\n`C:\\Users\\administrator\\svchost.exe`\n\nTo make sure the rule doesn't miss cases where the executable would be started from a sub-folder of these locations, the entire path is checked for the process path. The below example should be considered as suspicious:\n\n`C:\\Windows\\System32\\srv\\svchost.exe`",
